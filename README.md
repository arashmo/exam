# BASF  ðŸš€

Welcome to the ***BASF-challenge***This beta version has been carefully crafted using a blend of technologies and tools to facilitate streamlined deployments. 
1. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the necessary skills for designing and managing infrastructure as code (IaC). 
2. Additionally, it aims to showcase proficiency with the LLM (Large Language Model) system, creating a workflow that downloads and converts an LLM binary model, making it compatible with TorchServe. In this project, TorchServe has been used, but RayServe has been considered due to its scalability potential, (Pull request coming up soon)

## how to use ðŸŒŸ

## prequisities
1- docker-ce, for building and running the image

4- conda or miniconda installed on the system 


### how to the project structured 
- **make**: run ```make help`` for more information 
- **Terraform Files**: constructed modular or the aks,kuberenetes, congintive-services and also integrated with kustomize, checkout ./terraform/README.ME
- **Kustomize Files**: we have base project and dev verions, dev version spin up a deployment specifically for the development,
